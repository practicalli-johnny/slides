** Abstract

Light Table demonstrates a new breed of interactive coding tools, 
based on Bret Victor's "Designing on Principle". 

With Light Table, you can create Clojure & ClojureScript apps that run inside the development tool, 
giving you the ultimate fast feedback. 

This session will show a new way of developing that is fast, effective and fun.

* What is LightTable

A developer tool for Clojure development 

[[http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ibdknox/light-table][A kickstarter project]] 

Inspired by Bret Victor's talk: [[http://vimeo.com/36579366][Inventing on Principle]]

* Inventing on Principle 

** Bret's principle 

Bringing ideas into the world is one of the most important things to do 
- ideas give meaning to peoples lives 

[[./images/creating-ideas.png]]

** Nurturing ideas by connecting to creations 
Creators need to see the affect as soon as a change is made

[[./images/inventing-on-principle-interact-bounce-trace-adjust.png]]

** Ideas start small,
need an environment where the creator can nurture and let them grow 
** Find a guilding Principle

Find something you believe is important, neccessary and right 

http://worrydream.com/

* Traditional coding approach
Has not evolved much since punch cards & teletypes  
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag highlight-red
 - code > compile > run > result
 - switch between results and code
 - constantly loosing connection with the app you are creating
 
** Classic IDE's make your eyes jump around
 
[[./images/eclipse-counterclockwise-clojure-project.png]]

* Applying these principles to software development
** Make changes as quickly as you think of them 
-- understand the possibilities by interacting with your creation
 
-[[./images/think_in_code.jpg]]

** Interacting with your creation directly...

... more ideas flow when you have to parsing less code 
** Use your brain effectively 
When you look at code you have to "play commputer"
- you have to imagine in your head what each line of code does
- you become the interpreter & runtime ...

** Find bugs as soon as you type them... 

... instead of leaving it to the unit tests, compiler or person using the software!

* Similar approaches

[[http://seb.ly/][Seb.ly]] for Creative development 

[[http://vimeo.com/36278748][CreativeJS for Designers]]

** Command Line feedback

Using zsh to show current branch & change 

[[./images/zsh-visualising-status-examples.png]]

Showing namespaces in the REPL 

[[./images/clojure-repl-custom-colour-text.png]]

* Principles Driving LightTable

 - never have to look for documentation
 - files are not the best representation of code
 - editors can be anywhere and show you anything
 - trying is encouraged
 - changes produce instantaneous results
 - shine light on related pieces of code


** Live Feedback 

Inital concept idea:
[[./images/lighttable-concept-live-eval.png]]
 
#+REVEAL: split
Early implementation: 
[[./images/light-table-example.png]]


** Responsive development 

[[./images/lighttable-concept-game-example.png]]

* Status of the LightTable project

 - now an [[http://www.lighttable.com/2014/01/07/light-table-is-open-source/][open source project]] on [[https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable][Github]]
 - active community & issue tracker via Github project
 - good documentation

** Multiple language support 

  - Clojure & ClojureScript
  - JavaScript, HTML, CSS
  - Python

** Why is LightTable worth a look 

- easy to setup 
- fast feedback
- results embedded in the code
- your app is side by side in the tool (webapps & graphics)
- a great tool for learning a language 

** Has LightTable met its original goals

 - Not yet...
 - Focused on a solid platform, so original goals still atainable 
 - Time will tell if "the development tool" for Clojure

* Getting LightTable

Install latest 5.x version from http://www.lighttable.com/ 
 - Linux 32bit / 64bit
 - Mac OSX
 - Windows 

* LightTable Features 
* Fast Feedback 

See what your code does as you type it
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag highlight-blue
 - Evaluate code in place 
 - Inline docs 
 - Instarepl
 - Embedded browser 


* Quick demo - Evaluating code

** Create a new project 
#+BEGIN_SRC bash  
lein new my-project 
#+END_SRC

[[./images/clojure-leiningen-new-project.png]] 

** Open project in Lightable

1. Run LightTable
2. Open the workspace view
   - Ctrl-Space toggle workspace
3. Add the project folder
4. Open the src/my-project/core.clj file
   - Ctrl-o core.clj


** Show the current Workspace
[[./images/lighttable-workspace-key-combo.png]]

** Add a project folder 

[[./images/lighttable-workspace-folder-add.png]]

** Open a file 

Open a file from any folder added to the workspace 

[[./images/lighttable-open-file.png]]

** Connecting to a Clojure REPL
Starts a new REPL using the project.clj definition

[[./images/lighttable-connect-keyboard-combo.png]]

#+REVEAL: split
Evaluates all the code in the opened file

[[./images/lighttable-connect-evaluated-code.png]]

** Show REPL connections
See what connections you have open
 - reset and disconnect connections 

[[./images/lighttable-connections-show.png]]

** Interact with Code 

Type some Clojure expressions and evaluate with Ctrl-Enter 

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure 
(+ 1 2 3 4 5)
(println "Hello LightTable")
(def message "Give me fast feedback")
(apply + '(1 2 3 4 5))
#+END_SRC 

#+REVEAL: split
Evaluate a single expression with Ctrl + Enter 
[[./images/lighttable-eval-simple-expression.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

Evaluate all the code with Ctrl + Shift + Enter 
[[./images/lighttable-eval-simple-expressions.png]]

** Evaluating further 

Define a message string 

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure 
(def message "Give me fast feedback")

(defn welcome-message 
 "Send a persons a welcome message"
 [name]
 (str name ", " message)
)

(welcome message "JAX")
#+END_SRC 

** Inline Error messages
See clearly where problems are...
[[./images/lighttable-eval-error-message-inline-defn.png]]

#+REVEAL: split
... see when they are resolved
[[./images/lighttable-eval-error-message-inline-defn-fixed.png]]

** Define another function 

Lets write a simple function, with docs too!

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure 
(defn multi-me 
  "Multiple a number by itself"
  [number]
  (/ number number))

(multi-me 5)
#+END_SRC 

** Evaluate the function - Ctrl + Enter

- checks the function evaluates correctly
- make the function available to use in the current namespace 

[[./images/lighttable-eval-function-multi-me.png]]


** Call the function - Ctrl + Enter 
- see the result of calling the function with a parameter
- change the parameter and use Ctrl + Enter to re-evaluate 

[[./images/lighttable-eval-function-multi-me-call.png]]


** Break the code
What if we had typed divide instead of multiply...

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure 
(multi-me 0)
#+END_SRC 

[[./images/lighttable-eval-error-div-by-zero.png]]


** Calling functions not yet evaluated

Defined a function and trying to call it without evaluating it

[[./images/lighttable-eval-call-function-not-evaluated.png]]

#+REVEAL: split
Evaluate the function then the call to that function 
[[./images/lighttable-eval-order-of-eval.png]]


** Hiding evaluation Results

Simply right click on the result you want to hide and select "Remove result"

[[./images/lighttable-eval-remove-result.png]]


* If you can see what the code is doing, do you need unit tests ?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
[[./images/TDD-cycle.png]]

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
Yes, unit tests are about more than testing code...


* Inline docs 

** Show the docs 
Right click on a function name 
 - Right click on doc to close 

[[./images/lighttable-inline-docs-toggle-docs.png]]

#+REVEAL: split
[[./images/lighttable-show-docs-map.png]]

** Show docs for your own functions 

[[./images/lighttable-inline-docs-high-score-example.png]]

** Code moves out of the way 

[show longer function with several lines of expressions, where does the documentation appear]
[[./images/lighttable-inline-docs-larger-example.png]]

** Hide the docs

Right click and select Remove result 

[[./images/lighttable-inline-docs-larger-example-remove.png]]

** Toggle the docs 

 Ctrl + Space Toggle documentation at cursor

[[./images/lighttable-inline-docs-toggle-docs.png]]


* Instarepl

  Use Instarepl to evaluate your code as you type 

 - Evaluation character by character 

 - Re-evaluate when ever you change code 

** Instarepl workflow - new idea 
Advantages:
 - no project required  
 - no namespace definition required 
 - quick way to test out code
 - really easy way to start learning Clojure 


** Create a new Instarepl 

[[./images/lighttable-instarepl-open.png]]


** Evauating code on the fly

Example: Adding numbers together

[[./images/lighttable-instarepl-live-addition-5.png]]

#+REVEAL: split
Re-evaluate as you add more numbers 

[[./images/lighttable-instarepl-live-addition-10.png]]


** Adding Instarepl to your current editor

1. Open project in workspace 
2. Open file(s) to work on
3. Connect the file(s) to Instarepl



** Multiple REPL sessions

Choose which REPL session to connect to

[[./images/lighttable-instarepl-multiple-repl-choice.png]]


* Example: Learning Clojure Koans

[[http://clojurekoans.com/][Clojure Koans]] are a practical way to learn the language

- use LightTable Instarepl to solve the Koans

** Clone the Koans from Github

#+BEGIN_SRC zsh
git clone https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans.git
#+END_SRC


** Open the Koans folder in LightTable 
1. Ctrl + Space toggle workspace
2. Click on folder
3. Select the Koans folder (containing project.clj)
4. Open the first Koan (click on filename or Ctrl + o filename)
5. Delete first line and trailing parentheses

** Update the Clojure version

LightTable needs to run Clojure 1.5.1 or greater
- edit the project.clj file 

[[./images/lighttable-instarepl-koans-project-clj-version-update.png]]


#+REVEAL: split 
If you dont update the Clojure version, you cannot run Instarepl

[[./images/lighttable-instarepl-koans-cannot-connect.png]]

** Make the current editor an Instarepl

[[./images/lighttable-instarepl-koans-make-current-editor-instarepl.png]]

** Koans are awaiting to be solved 
Each challenge shows an errors

[[./images/lighttable-instarepl-koans-to-be-solved.png]]


** Solving the Koans
[[./images/lighttable-instarepl-koans-being-solved.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

All the Koans are solved

[[./images/lighttable-instarepl-koans-solved.png]]


* Connecting to your own projects

** lein-light leiningen plugin 
use your own projects as the context for the Instarepl

** Install lein-light

In your ~/.lein/profiles.clj
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure 
{:user {:plugins [[lein-light "0.0.4"]]}}
#+END_SRC

** Connecting to the REPL 

#+BEGIN_SRC zsh 
cd my-project 
lein light
#+END_SRC

Ctrl-Space Add Connection 

Select Clojure (remote nREPL)



* Code Watches 

Understanding what constructs are doing

JavaScript interaction 


* Embedded Browser 

* Driving Browser with node app 

Create a node application 
Add any depenencies
Start the node web app
Open browser tab in LT
Open main .js file in LT
Edit main .js file and see change reflected in the browser

Interact with your application live 

Works well with 
- JavaScript
- ClojureScrpt

* LightTable terminology

What is...

Eval?
Eval, short for evaluation, is the act of executing code inside of a running process. This means you modify the code that is currently executing without having to restart whatever you're doing.

** REPL?
Read-Eval-Print-Loop
 - enter code, evaluate that code and immediately return the result.
 - a great way to experiment and discover your language & libraries 
 - allows you to evaluate code in a file to see what something does

** Instarepl?
An editor that evaluates as you type
 - shows the result of an expression
 - how all the variables in your code are filled in to get that result. This
 - allows you to see data flow through your program
 - a kind of real-time debugging. 
 - Results are blue
 - Variable values are purple

** Client
 - a process connected to Light Table that can be sent messages 
 - messages generally relate to evaluating code in that process 
   - but they don't have to. 

 - eg. to eval Python code, a Python process runs which talks to Light Table over TCP and acts a client for us to send code to.

** Workspace

 - The group of files and folders that you are working with
 - Workspaces are saved and created automatically
 - access last 20 workspaces via "recent" button at top of the workspace tree

** Behavior
Light Table's functionality is defined by functions that respond to a set of triggers. 

This combination of a function and the triggers that it reacts to is called a behavior. 

Behaviors serve as the way to define what Light Table does in any number of situations and operate as a very powerful settings system. 
Behaviors are not applied directly to objects, 
but rather to "tags". These tags allow you to specify behavior for kinds of things at different levels of specificity. 

For example, you can apply behavior to all editors by adding a behavior to the :editor tag or to only clojure editors by adding it to the :editor.clojure tag. 
To modify behaviors, execute the Settings: User behaviors command.

* WIP

** Interacting with Graphics 

Visualising Binary search tree algorithm
Visualising different search algoritms 
Drawing simple shapes and changing them 


** Creating a project from inside lighttable 
can you create a new project from within lighttable, using leiningen ?


** Behaviours

*** Showing the workspace on start up

always display the workspace panel, in user.behaviors add this behavior to the :app section:

:lt.objs.sidebar.workspace/workspace.open-on-start



*** Run on start 
run on start behavior lets you do all kinds of clever things

It appears to follow the similar pattern to the other behaviour configs. Here's an example of one that worked for me:  

{:+ {:app [(:lt.objs.app/run-on-init :toggle-console)]

If you want more than one command to run you can pass in a vector of them:

{:+ {:app [(:lt.objs.app/run-on-init [:toggle-console ....])]

Note that I had to use auto-completion within the keymap bindings file to lookup the appropriate keyword for the command, so yeah it will be nice when some in-line auto-completion help gets added, but I imagine that will come.



** Defining your own customisations


Q: How do you select the current line, like ctrl+l in Sublime Text

A: add it to your keymap:

     :editor {"ctrl+l" [:editor.select-line]}

Or you could use 'V' in vim mode or emacs ....



** Tweakts 

*** V0.5.16 onwards

ADDED: Clojure mode can now color (comment ...) forms as comments. Use the `Clojure: Highlight comment forms as comments` behavior
ADDED: `Instarepl: set start content` behavior, set it to "" to remove the intro. #827


ADDED: `App: Run commands on start` behavior to let you run whatever when LT is opened. I.e. make full screen, toggle the workspace tree, etc.

an example:

{:+ {:app [(:lt.objs.app/run-on-init :toggle-console)]

If you want more than one command to run you can pass in a vector of them:

{:+ {:app [(:lt.objs.app/run-on-init [:toggle-console ....])]

Note that I had to use auto-completion within the keymap bindings file to lookup the appropriate keyword for the command, so yeah it will be nice when some in-line auto-completion help gets added, but I imagine that will come.


*** Display workspace panel at startup 
always display the workspace panel, in user.behaviors add this behavior to the :app section:

:lt.objs.sidebar.workspace/workspace.open-on-start


*** Defining your own syntax highlihting 

I was able to get the proper syntax highlighting for edn files by putting the following in my user.behaviors file:

{:+ {:files [(:lt.objs.files/file-types [{:name "edn" :exts [:edn] :mime "text/x-clojurescript" :tags [:editor.clj]}])]}}


*** Stop the spinny cubes from spinning

 `Statusbar: reset working indicator` command


*** Working with HTML5 video

 for licensing reasons, node-webkit doesn't ship with the proprietary codecs. See this for how to add them:
https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki/Support-mp3-and-h264-in-video-and-audio-tag


 website featuring a video using simple html5 video tag:

 <video width="640" height="360" id="blablaVideo" autoplay="true">
    <source src="assets/blabla.mp4">
 </video>



*** Paredit fun
Holy paredit commands Batman! I've added a few simple ones that can be composed into doing some neat things. For example with the select expression and clear selection commands you can format a parent expression, or eval it, or delete it, or ... Here's an example from user keymap:

:editor {;;Eval the parent ( ... )
         "alt-enter" [(:paredit.select.parent "(")
                      :eval-editor-form
                      :paredit.select.clear]
         
         ;;Select the parent expression, whether that's [], {}, or ()
         "shift-alt-s" [:paredit.select.parent]
         
         ;;Format the parent ()
         "alt-s" [(:paredit.select.parent "(")
                  :smart-indent-selection
                  :paredit.select.clear]
         
         ;;Slurp and Barf, with less ridiculous and more intuitive names
         "alt-shift-." [:paredit.grow.right]
         "alt-shift-," [:paredit.shrink.right]}


ADDED: Basic paredit commands! `Paredit: Grow right`, `Paredit: Grow left`, `Paredit: Shrink right`, `Paredit: Shrink left`, `Paredit: Select expression`, `Paredit: Clear selection and return cursor`


*** Misc

Allow both {:- {:app ["key"]}} and {:- {:app {"key" [..]}}} for keymap removal

*** Highlight line performance issues 
I turned highlight-line off by default due to the performance issues it carries with it. To turn it back on open your user behaviors and add the :lt.objs.editor/highlight-current-line behavior to the :editor tag.


*** connecting to remote repl - libs required

To allow LT to connect to a remote repl, you have to add in the lighttable-ops middleware. A simple project.clj looks like this:

(defproject lttest "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "FIXME: write description"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.5.1"]
                 [lein-light-nrepl "0.0.1"]]
  :repl-options {:nrepl-middleware [lighttable.nrepl.handler/lighttable-ops]})
