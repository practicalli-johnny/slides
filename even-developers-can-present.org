* We Developers are very social 

** No really we are !!

In no way are we shy, awkward, introverted...

** Well not when we are sufficiently motivated
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- so find some motivation to talk!
  

* Finding motivation 

This is probably the hardest thing to do
- if you are not motivated its easy to put it off

** Think about what excites you (technically)

 - What languages do you love?
 - What frameworks do you worship?
 - What tools would you trade your family for?
 - What did you learn at work today?


** What do you work on that you dont get paid for

What would you like to get paid to do that you currently dont!

** What do you talk to your friends about

- what are they tired of you banging on about?

Lots of other people will be interested in that

** Share your ideas and stories at meetups

See what topics you feel comfortable talking about at events

** What ever interests you, some other developers out there will also find interesting 


* Realise you have something to Say

Developers want to hear experiences from other Developers

- you dont need to be an expert
- share your personal experiences

** In the land of the blind...

... the one eyed man is king

 - We all have things we dont know much about
 - We all have gaps in our knowledge and experience
 - Software Development is too big to know everything

** Most Developers will be interested in most of what you want to say 

* Keep to the point

** Start with a Lightning talk

 - Talk about something specific within 5 minutes
 - Realise you will over-run 5 minutes (everyone does) 
 - Get some feedback on the content
   - what did developers find interesting
   - what do developers want to hear more about 

** Have a basic structures

You are telling a story, so there is a begining, middle and end 

Begining
 - tell people why the subject is interesting (context)

Middle
 -  the meat of the story, what happens, how does it happen

End
 - what was the point of the story, what should the audience do next






* Little details

Some tips to get you going

** Just the bare essentials 

Dont go crazy with slides / bullet-points
 - just enough to support the story 

** Mix up the content 

Use a mixture of images and text  
 - different stimuli keeps people engaged

** Stay focused on what you are talking about

Think about what you are going to say and why you are saying it

 - everything else is irrelevant

** Projectors are not your friends 

Check your presentation on every projector you meet
  - do it well before you start
  - check all the tools you'll use 
  - ensure colours of text can be seen
  - check font size is big enough
    - sand at the back of the room and look
  - learn how to change font sizes quickly 

** Keep distracted while you wait to speak 
 - play some music or find other distractions before you start
 - check you can change font sizes 
 - start writing your presentation (advanced speakers only)

** Say "Thank You" at the end 

Pause afterwards so people know when to clap
 - remember developers can be a shy bunch, so be patient.


* Enjoy it, we are all human

Developers are social and friendly
 - especially to other developers 

If all else fails, think of the Nike slogan

* Just Do It 

Thank you....

(pause for applause)
